     <li class="lead">SoftSlip wants to ensure your satisfaction with our service. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied, please contact us at&nbsp;SoftSlip.com Provide us with a brief explanation of the nature of your dissatisfaction and we will move quickly to process your refund. The following reasons warrant a 100% refund:</li>
     </ol>
     <ul>
     <li class="lead">The listed purchase price of the content and the actual amount SoftSlip debited varies. Reasons that your account/e-wallet will not be refunded:</li>
     <li class="lead">Intention to defraud SoftSlip by making a false claim of failed transactions. An excessive request for refunds after a refund has already been made to an account. This may result in future denials of refunds. Computer hardware and/or software failure (e.g., computer crash), including Internet connection, of the SoftSlip customer. SoftSlip refuses to accept fault for customer hardware/software issues and will not honor refunds associated with these issues.</li>
     <li class="lead">A refund for funds in e-wallet unused for transactions for more than 6 months.</li>
     </ul>
     <ol start="2">
     <li class="lead">You also acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, SoftSlip&rsquo;s issuance of a refund is only confirmation that SoftSlip has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale and that SoftSlip has no control over when the refund will be applied towards your Payment Methods available balance. You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer.</li>
     </ol>
     <ol start="3">
     <li class="lead">In the event, a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then SoftSlip, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either in the form of an in-store credit; or via refund to your originating account, through a reversal of the transaction.</li>
     </ol>
     <ol start="4">
     <li class="lead">SoftSlip also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method. For the avoidance of doubt, all refunds processed via the issuance of either in-store credits or a reversal are solely within SoftSlip&rsquo;s discretion and are not available at customer request.</li>
     </ol>
     <ol start="5">
     <li class="lead">Refunds for unused funds will be made after taxes have been deducted.</li>
